## Hi there 👋
> My name is Vaidas, and I'm an AI Engineer. I got a taste of computational design while designing the Mexico City Airport space frame roof (see below), and I've been hooked on coding ever since. I spend my days turning novel ML research into production-grade agentic systems for automated home design.
> 
> I have a background in structural engineering and architecture (ARUP → Nordic Structures), now focused on AI/ML, agentic architectures, full-stack web development, and MLOps.
