## Hi there üëã
My name is Vaidas, and I'm a recovering structural engineer üèóÔ∏è

> I started coding while designing architectural projects at ARUP in NYC - skyscrapers, bustling international airports, and arts and cultural landmarks. I later transitioned into a full-stack SWE at Nordic Structures in Montr√©al, and finished an MS in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

Curently, I'm building [march.fit](https://march.fit), a global fitness leaderboard challenge (Strava-Twitter hybrid), and working as an AI Engineer at Higharc, a cloud based platform for home builders.
