## Hi there 👋
My name is Vaidas, and I'm a recovering structural engineer 🏗️

> I started coding while designing bold architectural projects at ARUP - soaring skyscrapers, bustling international airports, and arts and cultural landmarks. Later, as a full-stack SWE at Nordic Structures in Montréal, I automated away the most complicated crux of mass timber connection design.

I returned to the 🇺🇸 to accept a scholarship from the University of Chicago, completing an MS in Computer Science in an intensive year-long hiatus from professional practice.  

Now, I'm building [march.fit](https://march.fit), a global fitness leaderboard challenge (Strava-Twitter hybrid), and working at an NYC-based, venture-backed startup in stealth.
