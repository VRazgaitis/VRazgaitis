## Hi there 👋
My name is Vaidas, and I'm a recovering structural engineer 🏗️

I started coding while building tools that bring bold architectural designs to life in skyscrapers, stadiums, and airports.

Now, I focus on distributed systems, cloud computing, and CI/CD pipelines that help dev teams move FAST 🏎️💨
